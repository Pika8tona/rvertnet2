\value{
A data frame of search results
}
\description{
Returns only those records in which the targeted input is found in
association with the specified search terms.  Not a global search.
}
\details{
\code{searchbyterm} builds a query from input parameters based on
   Darwin Core (dwc) terms (for the full list of terms, see
   https://code.google.com/p/darwincore/wiki/DarwinCoreTerms).
   The query string is appended to the base URL for VertNet
   search requests. View the query string for specification of
   dwc terms used in the search.

\examples{
\dontrun{

# Find multiple species
out <- searchbyterm(gen = "ochotona", sp = "(princeps OR collaris)")

# Find records in multiple locations
out <- searchbyterm(sp = "mustela nigripes", st = "(wyoming OR south dakota)")

# Limit the number of records returned to <1000; use bigsearch() for >1000 records
out <- searchbyterm(cl = "aves", st = "california", lim = 10)

# Specifying a single year (no quotes) or range of years (use quotes)
out <- searchbyterm(cl = "aves", st = "california", y = 1976)
out <- searchbyterm(cl = "aves", st = "california", y = ">=1976")

# Specifying a range (in meters) for uncertainty in spatial location (use quotes)
